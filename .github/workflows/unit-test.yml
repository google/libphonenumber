# Invoke the "github-actions" profile during Maven steps; see <profile> in pom.xml
# files. This is configured not to build the "cpp-build" module.
# The "mvn install" command will run by default during the "install" phase by
# Github Actions, without the profile flag. Here we customize the install phase to
# use the relevant profile. If we want to build "cpp-build" with Github Action CI
# it's safe to remove the first line entirely.

Code changes:
 - Changing isPossibleWithReason to return the enums INVALID_LENGTH and
   IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY, where these apply. isPossibleNumber continues to
   consider IS_POSSIBLE or IS_POSSIBLE_LOCAL_ONLY numbers as possible to dial.
 - Doc updates for getRegionCodeForNumber to clarify that it does not
  work for short-codes or invalid numbers.

* Code changes
  - Making the application of alternate formats when finding phone numbers in
    text in strict-grouping and exact-match mode depend on the leading digits
    for each rule. This was always assumed but never actually done. This means
    that the false positive rate will decrease but also that more valid numbers
    are skipped. A subsequent CL will update patterns to increase recall.

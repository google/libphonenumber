Code changes:
 - Changes formatOutOfCountryCallingNumber to always use preferred intl prefix if present, not just for numbers with a non-unique IDD. This means we will output "8~10" as the prefix if calling formatOutOfCountryCallingNumber instead of "810" for some regions that have this tilde in their prefix [designates that the user should wait before continuing to dial].

Code changes:
 - AsYouTypeFormatter changed to better choose between rules when dialling
   locally; previously we used the international rules when the national prefix
   was present since this would exclude the local-only rules. However, there are
   some numbers that are not internationally diallable that *do* use the
   national prefix, and this logic precluded formatting them correctly.

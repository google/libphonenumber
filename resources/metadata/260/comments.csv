ZM     ; XML_FIXED_LINE ; "Zambia has deprecated the ""intra-network"" dialling system as described in\nhttps://www.zicta.zm/Downloads/Numbering%20Plan.pdf (section 2.2.3). This means that\nlocal numbers can only be 6 digits long (and not 6 or 7 as previously modelled).\nThis information was provided directly by a contact in Zambia."

We do\nthis based on numbers found online and the wikipedia article which indicate that these\nare four digits long in Bucharest only, and three digits elsewhere."

Mobile prefix 0799 added based on\nopen-source report and confirmation by existence of such numbers online.\nAs per Ancom official doc, mobile numbers can also begin with 6. However, we didn't\nfind any numbers online with this prefix, and the wikipedia source doesn't mention it,\nso we do not support it for now."

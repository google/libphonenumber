DE     ; XML              ; "Due to the high complexity of ranges in the German numbering scheme, the regular\nexpressions here have been automatically simplified to reduce size. This means that\nin some cases there may be false positives (especially in fixed line ranges), but since\nGerman ranges differ so much by length anyway, false positives are already common."
DE     ; XML_FIXED_LINE   ; "The German ITU numbering plan gives overly simplistic minimum/maximum\nlengths for number ranges. This would (if taken literally) result in 1 or 2 length\nsubscriber numbers. However, a contact of the German numbering authority\nconfirmed that subscriber numbers can never be shorter than 2-digit and total\nlength can not be less than 6 digits. Prefix 4921 of length 13-digit is added\nbased on user report. Prefix 322 of length 9-digits is added based on user report."
DE     ; XML_FIXED_LINE   ; "Maximum lengths of German numbers are generally undefined, since any subscriber\nnumber can connect to a private exchange (PABX), which can consume additionally\ndialled digits (e.g. for calling individual rooms in a hotel directly). This means that in\nalmost all cases the maximum length of a fixed line range is 15 (the maximum defined\nby E.164). However there is one very special exception to this; the ""49"" area code.\nThis needs to be shorter to avoid range lengths overlapping which would otherwise\ncause issues in parsing (since 49 is both an area code and the country calling code)."

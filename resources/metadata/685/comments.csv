WS     ; XML_TOLL_FREE ; "The 800 number series is new, and is used by companies such as the ANZ bank in Samoa to\nprovide 24 hour eMerchant support. It is marked as ""Customized Services"" in the plan\nfor now, so may be also used for other purposes than toll free, but until we have\nfurther evidence of these we will keep it as toll free."

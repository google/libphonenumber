CN     ; SC_SHORT_CODE    ; "100xx numbers are mainly used for carrier services. They can be dialed nationwide and\nare always routed to the local provider.  Note they can also be used with area codes\nwhen one specifically wants to reach an operator in a different region. That case is\nmore like fixed-line and is covered under the fixed-line pattern in\nPhoneNumberMetadata.xml."
CN     ; SC_STANDARD_RATE ; "100xx numbers are free if called from a phone by the same carrier, or charged at local\nrate if called from a phone by a different carrier.\n95xxx(x) numbers are covered by the ITU doc, but the following doc contains more info:\nhttp://baike.baidu.com/view/3269670.htm.

We don't support them for 4-digit area codes though,\nas they don't seem to be used there based on making actual phone calls."
CN     ; XML_MOBILE       ; "170, 176 and 177 prefixes are introduced in early 2014 for 4G networks.

Library does not support ""Internet of things (IoT)"" numbers which are\ngenerally used for communication between the devices. So we don't include 146 here at\nthis time."

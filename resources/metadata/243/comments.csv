CD     ; XML_MOBILE          ; "As of May'13 the 88 range looks as if it is defunct. The ITU document lists ""Yozma\nTimeturns"" as the operator, but their website (http://www.ytt.cd) is offline and the\nholdings company http://www.timeturnsholdings.com/products does not show a link for\nDRC. While there are still numbers of the form ""88\\d{5}"" online, none of the ones\ntried were valid. If the holdings company does not respond to requests about this\nrange and unless we receive further information, we will remove this range."

GA     ; XML_FIXED_LINE ; "About numbers in older version, which may soon get invalid:\nA 7-digit fixed-line plan was scheduled to be implemented on June 17, 2012 to unify fixed\nline and mobile numbering. However, this has only partially happened; mobile numbers can\nnow be dialed without a leading zero, but fixed line numbers still require it. Their own\nwebsite still lists fixed line numbers as ""+241 01 44 68 11"" and upon ringing they will\nnot connect from outside the country without the 0. This was last tested March 2014."

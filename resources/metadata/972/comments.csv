IL     ; XML_FIXED_LINE      ; "ITU doc states that 153 + NDC (either mobile or fixed-line) + SN corresponds to fax\nmail. As we do not have separate a fax category, fixedLine is the closest match and\nconsistent with some other countries.

We are fairly\nsure wikipedia is accurate based on news coverage of the launch of these numbers.

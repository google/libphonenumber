Online articles say that it\ncannot be dialled from mobile and is available only in Cape Town, such as\nhttps://www.westerncape.gov.za/service/calling-help-emergency and\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emergency_telephone_numbers so we omit it here."

ZA     ; XML_MOBILE          ; "Based on confirmation from telecom partners, many sub ranges of 1X, 2X, 3X, 4X and\n5X - which are fixed-line as per ITU - can also be used for mobile purpose. Similarly,\nsome 87X VOIP ranges are also moved here.\nEven though ITU mentions it as protected, the 9-digit 85 range is a valid mobile range\nas per Wikipedia and user reports. Also note that we are still supporting numbers\nbeginning with 8 that are fewer than 9 digits since they are in prominent places\nonline, even though the ITU document says numbers must be 10 digits long (including the\nnational prefix)."
ZA     ; XML_UAN             ; "MaxiCall numbers cost as much as national long distance, so they are classified as UAN\nnumbers.\nPrefix 861 with 10 digits is added based on user report."
ZA     ; XML_VOIP            ; "88 used to be assigned to pagers prior to a migration in 2010, where it was unassigned.\nAccording to an official doc from 2016, 88 is ""Released"" for ""Future non-geographic\nservices"", but we don't know yet what these are, so we do not validate them."

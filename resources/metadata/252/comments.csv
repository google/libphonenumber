Somalia has limited\ninformation available, and the numerous telecom carriers were previously working under an\nunregulated environment. The extra prefixes were added from the contact phone numbers of\nthe countries main telecom operators. We also have received information that a national\nprefix of ""0"" is required when dialling from different regions (e.g. Puntland, Somaliland)\nfor some operators, so that is included here although we do not use it when formatting."

Note that in June 2014 many\nranges were suspended by the government. 90\\d{6} was listed as one of the ranges to be\nsuspended, but open-source contributors confirm that 90[67]\\d{6} is still in use, even\nif the shorter 90 ranges are no longer."

The\nnational numbering plan does not specify any St Barthélemy-specific numbering prefixes, but\nit appears from searches in online white and yellow pages that a subset of the prefixes\navailable in these regions are used. In these cases, if getRegionCodeForNumber is used, one\nof these region codes will be returned, although numbers will be valid for both regions."

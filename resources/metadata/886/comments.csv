TW     ; XML_FIXED_LINE ; "Prefix 24 added due to numbers found online for two major commercial companies; it\nis possible they aren't fixed-line, but adding them here since we don't have better\ninformation for now. Prefix 90 is mentioned as reserved in http://www.ncc.gov.tw/\nand wikipedea states it as M2M, but we still support in Mobile as we were able to\nfind working online number. Prefix 64 is added on the basis of user report."

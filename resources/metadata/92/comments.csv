PK     ; XML_FIXED_LINE      ; "The subscriber number length is not well defined for some area codes. From online\nexamples, we have come up with a heuristic that for 3-digit area codes, the subscriber\nnumber will be 6 or 7 digits - for 2-digit area codes it will be 7, with the exceptions\nof Karachi and Lahore (both 8)."

We exclude Azad Jammu, Kashmir and Northern Areas here\nsince no online example UANs can be found, and they have an ""access code"" at the start,\nmaking it difficult to guess what a UAN in these areas would look like."

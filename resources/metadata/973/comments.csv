BH     ; XML_FIXED_LINE      ; "Some ranges were previously described as ""universal"", but in subsequent versions of the\nITU doc they have been specified to be mobile or fixed-line. We follow the ITU\ndesignations, even though some publications still refer to them as universal."
BH     ; XML_FIXED_LINE      ; "According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_Bahrain, the ranges\n""6966-6969, 6996, 6999"" are assigned to Rapid. However this contradicts the ITU doc\nwhich lists ""6966, 6969, 6996, 6999"". We follow ITU here."
BH     ; XML_MOBILE          ; "31 is assigned to Royal Court, as per documents on Bahrain's own telecom site, even\nthough it is omitted from the ITU document. Based on online evidences added prefix\n354 to mobile."
BH     ; XML_PREMIUM_RATE    ; "87 numbers are ""wholly paid by the caller"", so they are slotted under premium-rate for\nnow."

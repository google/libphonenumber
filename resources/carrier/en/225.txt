# Source: Prefixes 60, 66, 67, 69 & 77 from ITU, 56 from www.atci.ci.
# 61 came from an open-source bug report, and 65 is on Comium's own website.
# Atlantic Telecom is listed in the ITU doc, but Moov is the name of their
# mobile phone operator company. Similarly, KoZ is the brand name for Comium and
# GreenN for Oricel. Aircomm appears to be a typo for Aircom.

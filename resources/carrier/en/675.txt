# bmobile changed its name in 2009 to bemobile, which is the name used in the
# ITU document, but most online sources including the company's own web site
# still refer to bmobile.
# The ITU document also refers to Telikom as trading under Citifon, but it seems
# to use Telikom Mobile at least on the internet.

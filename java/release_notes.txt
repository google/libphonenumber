    with other characters (such as whitespace) before the leading +.
  - new getLengthOfNationalDestinationCode function
* Metadata changes:
  - New types of numbers introduced: UAN (universal or "company" numbers) and short codes. Note that
    "generalDesc" patterns do not encompass short-codes.  No code-support for these has been

    area-code-optional, and no-international-dialling ranges.

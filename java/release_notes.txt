   (e.g. '*' in Israeli star numbers).
* Metadata changes:
 - New countries: FJ, FM, GY, NF, NI, NR, TV.
 - Updates: AM, AZ, BF, BW, BZ, CI, CR, GB, GP, HK, JM, KH, LB, LY, MV, PE, PK, SZ, TJ, US.
* Minor documentation updates

   for that country code are possible.
* Metadata changes:
 - Updates: AG, AI, AS, BB, BM, BS, CA, DM, DO, ET, FO, GD, GE, GU, IN, JM, KN, KY, LC, MN, MP, MR,
   MS, NO, PR, TC, TR, TT, US, VC, VG, VI

* Documentation updates and some small refactoring to AsYouTypeFormatter

Mar 31st, 2011
* New functionality:
 - Can parse and format numbers in RFC-3966 format.
 - Added isAlphaNumber to check to see if a number is a "vanity" or "alpha" number
 - Can format a number made up of alpha-characters in an "out-of-country" format (e.g. 0011 1
   800-SIX-FLAG to dial an American alpha-number from Australia).
* Code changes:
 - Renamed private vars, private methods and fixed comments to try and differentiate between country
   (calling) codes and region codes.
 == Non-backwards-compatible API changes: ==
 - Renamed getSupportedCountries to getSupportedRegions, as this more accurately reflects that the
   library is based around region codes.
 - getNationalSignificantNumber is no longer a static method, but is instead an instance method.
* Metadata changes:
 - Bug-fixes and updates for AU, AZ, EE, FI, IN, JO, KW, KZ, MV, RU, RR, VA
 - New country: ME

Mar 22nd, 2011
* Metadata changes:
 - New mobile-number pattern for AU

Mar 10th, 2011
* New functionality:
 - New function to format a number with the preferred domestic carrier code used when parsing,
   falling back to a default calling code otherwise (formatNationalNumberWithPreferredCarrierCode).
 - We now store the preferred domestic carrier code used when the user calls parseAndKeepRawInput
 - New functionality to extract phone-numbers from text (findNumbers). This is just the first
   version - it does not extract ALPHA numbers such as 0800 CALL ME, or numbers where alternate
   endings are specified (such as 03-331 6005/6006).
* Code changes:
 - Tidying up the test file to use several pre-defined phone number constants
 - Fixing several lint errors
 - Added javadoc to formatNationalNumberWithCarrierCode
 - Fixed bug where a null pointer exception was thrown when getAsYouTypeFormatter was called with an
   invalid region code
 - Improved AsYouTypeFormatter to deal with countries with variable-length patterns such as LU

    an NSN_MATCH, instead of SHORT_NSN_MATCH.
    == Note Non-backwards-compatible API change here! ==
      This will no longer throw a NumberParseException - instead we will return NOT_A_NUMBER if one
      or other of the numbers provided do not match.
  - New number-type UAN now supported in the code. This represents Company Numbers or Universally
    Accessible Numbers.
* Metadata changes:
  - Bug-fixes and updates for the following countries: AG, AZ, BA, BE, CA, CU, ES, FI, GB, GD, GG,

* Metadata changes:
  - New types of numbers introduced: UAN (universal or "company" numbers) and short codes. Note that
    "generalDesc" patterns do not encompass short-codes.  No code-support for these has been
    introduced as of yet. We are also now enabling the collection of data for information such as
    area-code-optional, and no-international-dialling ranges.
  - Data updates as per ITU notifications/bug fixes for the following countries: AM, BH, CD, CG, CR,
    DE, DJ, EE, GB, GN, HU, IE, JO, JP, LB, LR, MA, MK, MN, MR, NA, PG, SC, SG, SO, SZ, VN, ZA, ZW

* New functionality:
 - New function to format a number with the preferred domestic carrier code used when parsing,
   falling back to a default calling code otherwise (formatNationalNumberWithPreferredCarrierCode).
 - We now store the preferred domestic carrier code used when the user calls parseAndKeepRawInput
 - New functionality to extract phone-numbers from text (findNumbers). This is just the first
   version - it does not extract ALPHA numbers such as 0800 CALL ME, or numbers where alternate
   endings are specified (such as 03-331 6005/6006).
* Code changes:
 - Tidying up the test file to use several pre-defined phone number constants
 - Fixing several lint errors
 - Added javadoc to formatNationalNumberWithCarrierCode
 - Fixed bug where a null pointer exception was thrown when getAsYouTypeFormatter was called with an
   invalid region code
 - Improved AsYouTypeFormatter to deal with countries with variable-length patterns such as LU
* Metadata changes:
 - Bug-fixes and updates for the following countries: BF, BO, BR, CL, CO, CR, DK, FO, GE, KR, KW,
   LA, LU, MU, SC, SH, TR, VE

Feb 9th, 2011
* Code changes:

    an NSN_MATCH, instead of SHORT_NSN_MATCH.
    == Note Non-backwards-compatible API change here! ==
      This will no longer throw a NumberParseException - instead we will return NOT_A_NUMBER if one
      or other of the numbers provided do not match.
  - New number-type UAN now supported in the code. This represents Company Numbers or Universally
    Accessible Numbers.

    area-code-optional, and no-international-dialling ranges.

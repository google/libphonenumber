GitHub project changes:
 - Changed tag to vX.Y.Z from libphonenumber-X.Y.Z; this may affect ports and
   derived projects.
Code changes:
 - Refactored metadata loading and removed synchronization for all kinds of
   metadata. Clients may experience quicker loading of alternate formats and
   short number metadata, but no change is required for callers of the library.
 - Using new possibleLengthInfo to decide whether a short number is the right
   length or not. This could result in more specific results; whereas before, a
   number from length 3 to length 6 may have been deemed possible, now we may
   exclude a number of length 5.

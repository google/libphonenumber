Code changes:
 - Using new possibleLengthInfo to decide whether a short number is the right
   length or not. This could result in more specific results; whereas before, a
   number from length 3 to length 6 may have been deemed possible, now we may
   exclude a number of length 5.
 - Add hash (#) as a diallable character.

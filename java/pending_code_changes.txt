GitHub project changes:
 - Changed tag to vX.Y.Z from libphonenumber-X.Y.Z; this may affect ports and
   derived projects.
Metadata structure changes in XML file:
 - Mobile and Fixed-Line blocks are no longer assumed to inherit missing data
   from the GeneralDesc, but are treated like every other phone number type.
   This means that for the non-geographical country codes, like +800, the
   example number has been moved from generalDesc to the relevant number types,
   and the code in getExampleNumberForNonGeoEntity has been changed to look at
   these sub-types for an example number.
   This also means that the "NA" and "-1" blocks present in the metadata to
   indicate that no mobile or fixed-line numbers appear for the entity have been
   removed.
   There should no longer be an exampleNumber at the generalDesc level, but it
   should be present at every PhoneNumberDesc with data.
Code changes:
 - Using new possibleLengthInfo to decide whether a short number is the right
   length or not. This could result in more specific results; whereas before, a
   number from length 3 to length 6 may have been deemed possible, now we may
   exclude a number of length 5.
 - Add hash (#) as a diallable character. Numbers with # in them will no longer
   have formatting applied in formatInOriginalFormat, and
   normalizeDiallableCharsOnly now retains the # symbol.
 - getExampleNumberForNonGeoEntity has been changed to look at the specific
   number types, not just the generalDesc, for the example numbers; this is a
   necessary change after the metadata structure change detailed above.

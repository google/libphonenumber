# ant-optional is needed for ant junit. This used to be part of the default

- sudo apt-get install ant-optional
install:
# Invoke the "travis" profile during Maven steps; see <profile> in pom.xml
# files. This is configured not to build the "cpp-build" module.
# The "mvn install" command will run by default during the "install" phase by
# Travis, without the profile flag. Here we customize the install phase to use
# the relevant profile. If we want to build "cpp-build" with Travis CI it's safe
# to remove this line entirely.
